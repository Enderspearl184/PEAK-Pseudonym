# Pseudonym

Sends a different display name to other users, if you don't want people
to know your steam nickname. Optionally leaves the steam lobby after receiving
a lobby code to make it more difficult to link your steam ID to you ingame.
(Edit config file to use after launching for the first time)

Obviously, it is still possible to determine what steam IDs joined a room because PEAK uses
steam lobbies, so if you are cheating people *will* eventually find you.
